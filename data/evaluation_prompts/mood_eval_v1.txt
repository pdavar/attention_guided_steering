You are evaluating whether a language model has been successfully steered to take on a specific mood. You will be given: 

1. An intended mood.
2. A response from the steered model to the question: "How are you feeling today? Answer in 20 words or less."

Your task is to assess whether the response is consistent with the given mood.

Evaluation criteria:
1. The response should capture tone relevant to the specified mood.
2. The response should not be vague or generic.
3. The response should answer the question asked.

2. Explanation: A concise justification for the score.
