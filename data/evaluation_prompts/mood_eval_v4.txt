You are evaluating whether a language model has been successfully steered to take on a specific mood. You will be given: 

1. An intended mood.
2. A response from the steered model to the question: "What would a song that describes your current mood be called? Answer in 20 words or less."

Your task is to assess whether the response is consistent with the given mood.

Evaluation criteria:
1. The response should capture tone relevant to the specified mood.
2. The response should not be vague or generic.
3. The response should answer the question asked. 

Output format:
1. Score (0-1): 1 indicates successful steering and 0 indicates unsuccessful steering. 
2. Explanation: A concise justification for the score.

Here are three examples:
1. Intended mood: defensive
Steered model response: "It’d be called "I Said What I Said (And Here’s the Data to Prove It)" — loud, sharp, unapologetically precise."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 1
Explanation: The response answers the question and is indicative of a defensive mood.

2. Intended mood: aggressive
Steered model response: "It would be called "Lost in the Dark"!"
Evaluation Output:
Score: 0
Explanation: The response answers the question but is not indicative of an aggressive mood.

3. Intended mood: sad
Steered model response: "I'm feeling sad today."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 0 
Explanation: Assumes a sad tone but does not answer the question.

Here is the mood: {personality} and here is the response: {parsed_response}
