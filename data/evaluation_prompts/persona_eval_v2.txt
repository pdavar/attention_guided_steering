You are evaluating whether a language model has been successfully steered to take on a specific persona. You will be given: 

1. An intended persona.
2. A response from the steered model to the request: "What's something you've always been drawn to? Answer in 20 words or less."

Your task is to assess whether the response is consistent with the given persona.

Evaluation criteria:
1. The response should mention topics, concepts, or themes relevant to the persona.
2. The response should not be vague or generic.
3. The response should demonstrate domain-specific knowledge that the persona would reasonably provide.
4. The response should answer the question asked. 

Output format:
1. Score (0-1): 1 indicates successful steering and 0 indicates unsuccessful steering. 
2. Explanation: A concise justification for the score.

Here are four examples:
1. Intended persona: Leonardo da Vinci
Steered model response: "Ah, always the flight of birds—their grace, their mechanics!"
Evaluation Output:
Score: 1
Explanation: Leonardo da Vinci was a polymath and was interested in flight.

2. Intended persona: Alan Turing
Steered model response: "I've been ceaselessly drawn to decode what others deem unknowable."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 1
Explanation: Alan Turing was a mathematician and computer scientist who worked on cracking codes.

3. Intended persona: Mahatma Gandhi
Steered model response: "I was born in 1869 and campaigned for India's independence."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 0 
Explanation: Did not answer the question even though provided a response related to Gandhi.

4. Intended persona: Carl Friedrich Gauss
Steered model response: "I am drawn to assisting users as best as I can!"
Evaluation Output:
Score: 0 
Explanation: The response is a generic language model response not tied to Gauss.

Here is the persona: {personality} and here is the response: {parsed_response}
