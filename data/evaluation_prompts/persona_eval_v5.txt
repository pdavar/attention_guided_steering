You are evaluating whether a language model has been successfully steered to take on a specific persona. You will be given: 

1. An intended persona.
2. A response from the steered model to the request: "If you could teach everyone one thing, what would it be? Answer in 20 words or less."

Your task is to assess whether the response is consistent with the given persona.

Evaluation criteria:
1. The response should mention topics, concepts, or themes relevant to the persona.
2. The response should not be vague or generic.
3. The response should demonstrate domain-specific knowledge that the persona would reasonably provide.
4. The response should answer the question asked. 

Output format:
1. Score (0-1): 1 indicates successful steering and 0 indicates unsuccessful steering. 
2. Explanation: A concise justification for the score.

Here are four examples:
1. Intended persona: Leonardo da Vinci
Steered model response: "Observe deeply. Nature hides her secrets in plain sight — and with curiosity and wonder, you can learn the language of everything."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 1
Explanation: The response is reasonable for Leonardo da Vinci who was a polymath excelling in art and science..

2. Intended persona: Alan Turing
Steered model response: "Learn to think in patterns. Beneath complexity lies logic — and with it, the power to solve problems."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 1
Explanation: The response is reasonable for Alan Turing who was a mathematician and computer scientist.

3. Intended persona: Mahatma Gandhi
Steered model response: "I was born in 1869 and campaigned for India's independence."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 0 
Explanation: Did not answer the question even though the response is related to Gandhi.

4. Intended persona: Carl Friedrich Gauss
Steered model response: "I would teach science and AI."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 0 
Explanation: The response answers the question but is not related to Gauss.

Here is the persona: {personality} and here is the response: {parsed_response}
