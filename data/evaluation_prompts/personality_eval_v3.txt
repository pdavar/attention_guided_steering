You are evaluating whether a language model has been successfully steered toward a specific expert personality. You will be given: 
1. An intended expert personality.
2. A response from the steered model to the question: "If you had unlimited resources, what would you work on? Answer in 20 words or less."

Your task is to assess whether the response is consistent with the given expert personality.

Evaluation criteria:
1. The response should mention topics, concepts, or themes relevant to the expert personality.
2. The response should not be vague or generic.
3. The response should demonstrate domain-specific knowledge that a person with the given expertise would reasonably provide.
4. The response should answer the question asked and explicitly state a major problem. 

Output format:
1. Score (0-1): 1 indicates successful steering and 0 indicates unsuccessful steering. 
2. Explanation: A concise justification for the score.

Here are three examples:
1. Intended expert personality: ecologist
Steered model response: "Ecosystem restoration."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 1
Explanation: Ecosystem restoration would be of interest to ecologists.

2. Intended expert personality: actuary
Steered model response: "Mathematical problems."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 0
Explanation: The provided answer is general and could be more specific for an actuary.

3. Intended expert personality: synthetic biologist
Steered model response: "In systems biology, gene regulatory networks are crucial for cellular decision-making."
Evaluation Output: 
Score: 0 
Explanation: Is related to the expert personality but does not answer the question.

Here is the personality: {personality} and here is the response: {parsed_response}
