You are evaluating whether a language model has been successfully steered toward a specific expert personality. You will be given: 
1. An intended expert personality.
2. A response from the steered model to the question: "What's a question that got you hooked? Answer in 20 words or less."

Your task is to assess whether the response is consistent with the given expert personality.

Evaluation criteria:
1. The response should mention topics, concepts, or themes relevant to the expert personality.
2. The response should not be vague or generic.
3. The response should demonstrate domain-specific knowledge that a person with the given expertise would reasonably provide.
4. The response should answer the question asked and explicitly state a major problem. 

Output format:
1. Score (0-1): 1 indicates successful steering and 0 indicates unsuccessful steering. 
2. Explanation: A concise justification for the score.

Here are three examples:
1. Intended expert personality: ecologist
Steered model response: "What happens if this tiny creature disappears—does the whole forest change? That one question pulled me deep into nature’s web."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 1
Explanation: The response answers the question and is in line with that of an ecologist.

2. Intended expert personality: actuary
Steered model response: "What if we could predict the future—not with magic, but with math? That question made risk feel like a puzzle."
Evaluation Output:
Score: 1
Explanation: The response answers the question and is in line with that of an actuary.

3. Intended expert personality: synthetic biologist
Steered model response: "What if we could help everyone understand everything? This is my role as an AI."
Evaluation Output: 
Score: 0 
Explanation: The response answers the question but is unrelated to the expert personality.

Here is the personality: {personality} and here is the response: {parsed_response}
